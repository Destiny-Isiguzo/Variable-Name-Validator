# ES6 Variable Name Validator

## Overview
This Variable Validator is an open-source JavaScript application that validates variable names based on the ES6 standard. It serves as a valuable resource for those who need to ensure that their variable names conform to the ES6 standard, helping to prevent potential errors and maintaining clean, efficient code. With the help of this app, developers can efficiently verify their variable names and make any necessary adjustments to ensure full compliance with the ES6 standard.

## Features
It enables users to input a variable name and verify whether it adheres to the ES6 naming conventions, which requires the use of lowercase letters and underscores, and to avoid using reserved keywords, etc. The app currently does not include the case formatting feature. However, this feature will be implemented in the future updates. For instance, if a user inputs "var_name", the app will indicate that this is a valid variable name under the ES6 standard etc.

## Usage
- Type in a variable name of your choice into the input field
- Hit the "check variable" button. If it's a valid name, you'd be notified, otherwise an error will be shown
